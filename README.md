# The Urban Forestry Package (UFoR)

## About

The Urban Forestry for R Package, or UFoR, has been meticulously designed to bridge the gap between urban forestry and cutting-edge technological tools. Whether you're an arborist, urban forester, researcher, or tree care professional, UFoR offers you user-friendly tools to transform and streamline your urban forestry tasks.

## Quick and Easy Installation

UFoR can be easily installed directly from GitHub with the help of the devtools package. Execute the following commands in R to begin your UFoR journey:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lukasgolson/UFoR")
```

## Getting Started with UFoR

Once the UFoR package is installed, simply load it into your R session using the `library` function:

```R
library(UFoR)
```

UFoR comes packed with a plethora of functions dedicated to urban forestry tasks. To get a quick overview of all available functions, you can use the `help` function or sift through our extensive package documentation:

```R
help(package = "UFoR")
```

Additionally, we have a [Documentation Site](https://lukasdragon.github.io/UFoRDocumentation/) that you can check out for additional explanations about the functions and theory behind them.
